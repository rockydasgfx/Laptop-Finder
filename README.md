## the difference between state and props?

### State

1. Use state to store the data your current page needs in your controller view.
2. State Changes can be Asynchronous.
3. State can be changed or Modified using setState.

### Props

1. Use props to pass data & event handlers down to your child components.
2. Props are Read-Only.
3. Props can not be changed or Modified.

## How useState Work?

useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value and another function to update this value.
